# Plant-Pulse
# Desription
This project is a garden monitoring system that combines Arduino microcontrollers and various sensors to create a monitoring system for
gardens. It collects data from various sensors, processes it and take appropriate action.
# Key Features
## Sensor Integration
Utilizing different sensors such as soil moisture, humidity, light intensity and temperature sensors to collect data.
## Arduino microcontroller
Employing an Arduino Microcontroller to read the sensors data.
## Automatic Control
Offers the possibility to automate the control of actuators such as the water pump
## User interface
Grants a user friendly interface for users to visualize data, adjust settings and receive feedback.
## Data Analysis
Processes sensor data to generate insights about soil moisture levels, light exposure, temperature variations, and humidity levels..
# Tools
## Arduino boards:
Arduino boards serve as the central unit of the monitoring system
## Sensors:
Various sensors will be used in this project such as Soil moisture sensors, Light intensity sensors, temperature sensors, Humidity sensors...
## Actuators:
Actuators are the devices that will be used to preform actions based on the sensors data, for example the water pump.
## Breadboard and jumper wires:
These will be used for prototyping and connecting components.
## Arduino programing software:
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.
