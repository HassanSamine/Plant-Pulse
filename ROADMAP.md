# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step process for building this project, including component breakdown, simulation, and code development.

---

## **Step 1: Initialization**
- Set up a GitHub repository to manage project files and documentation.
- Install the required software:
  - **Arduino IDE** for programming.
  - **Proteus** for simulation.
- Gather all necessary components for the project.

---

## **Step 2: Component Breakdown**
- Break the project into manageable parts by focusing on individual components.
- For each component:
  - Create a dedicated file in the repository.
  - Learn the basics of programming and controlling the component:
    - Reference datasheets and tutorials for guidance.
    - Write and test small code snippets in the Arduino IDE to control the component.

---

## **Step 3: Create the Project in Proteus**
- Open **Proteus** and set up a new project.
- Add all components to the simulation workspace, including the Arduino board.


---

## **Step 4: Step-by-Step Code Development**
- Write the project's code in small, manageable sections.
- Test each section of the code with the corresponding hardware component or simulation:
  - Gradually integrate more complex components and features.
- Use version control to track changes:
  - Commit code updates regularly.
  - Tag milestones for significant progress.

---

## **Milestones**
- [ Done ] Initialize the GitHub repository and project.
- [ Done ] Complete component breakdown and testing.
- [ Done ] Build and simulate the project in Proteus/Tinker Cad.
- [ Done ] Finalize the code and hardware integration.
